## Before you begin

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes 1.20+
- Helm 3.3+

### Setup a Kubernetes Cluster

The quickest way to setup a Kubernetes cluster to install Bitnami Charts is following the "Bitnami Get Started" guides for the different services:

- [Get Started with Bitnami Charts using VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/get-started-tkg/)
- [Get Started with Bitnami Charts using VMware Tanzu Mission Control](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/tanzu-mission-control-get-started/)
- [Get Started with Bitnami Charts using the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/get-started-aks/)
- [Get Started with Bitnami Charts using the Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/get-started-eks/)
- [Get Started with Bitnami Charts using the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/get-started-gke/)
- [Get Started with Bitnami Charts using the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS)](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/get-started-charts-iks/)

For setting up Kubernetes on other cloud platforms or bare-metal servers refer to the Kubernetes [getting started guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/).

### Install Helm

Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

To install Helm, refer to the [Helm install guide](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) and ensure that the `helm` binary is in the `PATH` of your shell.

### Add Repo

The following command allows you to download and install all the charts from this repository:

```bash
$ helm repo add riftbit https://charts.riftbit.com/riftbit
```

### Using Helm

Once you have installed the Helm client, you can deploy a Riftbit Helm Chart into a Kubernetes cluster.

Please refer to the [Quick Start guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) if you wish to get running in just a few commands, otherwise the [Using Helm Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/) provides detailed instructions on how to use the Helm client to manage packages on your Kubernetes cluster.

Useful Helm Client Commands:
* View available charts: `helm search repo`
* Install a chart: `helm install my-release riftbit/<package-name>`
* Upgrade your application: `helm upgrade`
