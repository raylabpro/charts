In order to associate your pods with AWS IAM roles, follow the steps below:

* Annotate your namespace with the allowed role ARNs via `iam.amazonaws.com/permitted`:

    kubectl edit namespace my-namespace

    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: my-namespace
      annotations:
        iam.amazonaws.com/permitted: "<Role ARN or Regex matching role ARN(s)>"

* Annotate your pods with the desired role via `iam.amazonaws.com/role`:

    kubectl edit pod my-pod

    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-pod
      annotations:
        iam.amazonaws.com/role: "<Name of the ARN role>"

* Verify the role by entering your pod and executing the following command

    kubectl exec -ti my-pod bash
    curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
